This is a MongoDB Express ReactJs NodeJs project (front back algo) which is my favorite project so far

## In order to run the MongoDB server:
 - You must have mongoDB on your machine and know how to use it *kekw*
 - You must add an .env file in the server folder then add ```PORT=XXXX\n```
 - Depends on your OS you must add in the .env file 
 - on windows: ```DB_STRING='mongodb://0.0.0.0:27042/```
 - on linux: ```DB_STRING='mongodb://localhost:27042/```

## Run the Express server:
 - Before anything you MUST do: ```cd server``` followed by ```npm install```
 - Once every modules are downloaded you can do: ```npm run start``` to lanch the server back-end

## Run the React server:
 - Before anything you MUST do: ```cd client``` followed by ```npm install```
 - Once every modules are downloaded you can do: ```npm run start``` to lanch the server front-endback
